# About This Project
There is detailed documentation on getting started found in the [Public Rocket Scheduler Manual / Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjZDFl0SBjFbB50lH4XLWmV9kEasu8cz9QXw_n_anDg/edit?usp=sharing).
This project is designed to make it easier to schedule attendees of an event into sessions based on ranking of those sessions.
For example, if I was running a Game Night with 40 people, and there were 8 games to be played, but each person could only play 3 games due to time restraints, I would have them fill out a form and use the rankings they give to each game to determine which game they get placed in.
The program would automate most of this process for me, giving me fast and easy sessions/games to assign each attendee.
