<h1>About This Project</h1>
<p>There is detailed documentation on getting started found in the

</p>
<p>This project is designed to make it easier to schedule attendees of an event into sessions based on ranking of those sessions.</p>
<p>For example, if I was running a Game Night with 40 people, and there were 8 games to be played, but each person could only play 3 games due to time restraints, 
  I would have them fill out a form and use the rankings they give to each game to determine which game they get placed in.
</p>
<p>The program would automate most of this process for me, giving me fast and easy sessions/games to assign each attendee.</p>
